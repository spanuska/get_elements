Welcome to the get_random_elements 3 ways code challenge!

THE CHALLENGE
#The given environment is built out in lines 8-18 and includes...
	# An array (referenced here as "mystery_array"), containing an unknown # of elements
	# A get_element method that will return the next element in mystery_array

# The challenge has 3 parts, and the solutions are labeled accordingly within the code.
  # Part 1: Create a method that will return a random element from mystery array. 
  # Part 2: Create a method that returns a random element from mystery array
    # WITHOUT creating a new array to do so.
  # Part 3: Create a method that returns a random element from mystery array
    # by only looping once
    
INSTRUCTIONS
To run the file in the command line, first fork this repo and navigate to the get_elements directory,
which contains get_elements.rb. Open a repl such as irb or pry and require 'get_element.rb'.  Note that you will need to
provide the full path - for example, on my machine, the path is: 
/Users/spanuska/Development/code/get_elements/get_elements.rb. Once you have required the file, you can 
call any of the methods within the repl.

To run the tests, navigate to the get_elements directory and type the following command:
'rspec spec/get_elements_spec.rb'. Next, get excited about all the passing tests!

Note: in order to install rspec on your machine, see the instructions listed here: http://rspec.info/. 
To install pry, see the instructions listed here: http://pryrepl.org/.
